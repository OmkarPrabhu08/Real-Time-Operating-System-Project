# Real-Time-Operating-System-Project
TIME-LAPSE ACQUISITION USING REAL-TIME SCHEDULER ON LINUX & IMAGE PROCESSING
• Improved accuracy in image capturing rate using real-time sequencer managed by timer thread and semaphores.
• Processed, compressed images using OpenCV APIs and MPEG encoding in other threads.
• Used POSIX APIs for threading on AMP (Asymmetric Multi-Processing) system.
